## 📌 Overview

**ScanGo** is a next-generation **self-checkout web application** that transforms any smartphone into a **secure Point-of-Sale (POS)** system. Customers can **scan, pay, and leave**—without standing in checkout lines.

Built for **Microsoft Imagine Cup 2026**, ScanGo eliminates one of retail’s biggest pain points: **queues**.

> _“We’re not eliminating queues. We’re eliminating the need for them.”_

## ❗ Problem Statement

Traditional retail checkout systems suffer from:
- ⏳ **20–30% of shopping time wasted** in queues

## 💡 Solution: ScanGo

ScanGo introduces a **decentralized Scan-Pay-Leave ecosystem** that removes checkout bottlenecks entirely.

### 🔄 How It Works

1. **Auto Check-In**  
   App detects store using geolocation and loads store-specific inventory & pricing  

2. **Scan While Shopping**  
   Real-time barcode scanning using the phone camera  

3. **Smart Cart**  
   Live bill calculation with discounts and offers  

4. **Dual Payment Options**  
   - 💳 UPI (instant checkout)  
   - 💵 Cash (queue-free counter payment)  

5. **Digital Exit Pass**  
   One-time, cryptographically secure QR code  

6. **Frictionless Exit**  
   QR verified by security → customer exits instantly  

✅ **Zero queues. Zero confusion. Maximum security.**
